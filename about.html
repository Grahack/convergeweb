Converge traces its heritage back to languages as diverse as Python and Haskell, Icon and Smalltalk, and so on. It is intended to be an utterly practical, modern programming language, mixing proven elements from different sources into one coherent whole. Both language and libraries aim for clean design with a firm emphasis on pragmatics. Common idioms are easily expressed, while still allowing complex concepts to be expressed neatly.
