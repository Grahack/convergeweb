<h2>What is Converge?</h2>

Converge is a dynamic object orientated programming language with compile-time meta-programming facilities - put more simply, Converge has macros. On top of this facility is a simple mechanism which allows domain specific languages of arbitrary syntaxes to be embedded within Converge source files. Converge was designed and is implemented by <a href="mailto:ltratt@convergepl.org">Laurence Tratt</a>.
