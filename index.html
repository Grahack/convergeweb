<h2>What is Converge?</h2>

Converge is a dynamic object orientated programming language with compile-time meta-programming facilities, designed and implemented by <a href="mailto:ltratt@convergepl.org">Laurence Tratt</a>.


<h2>Current status</h2>

<p>Converge is currently under heavy development and is in the early prototype phase. As with any such software, it is not recommended that one relies on any substantial aspect of the current implementation, which are all subject to change without notice. Furthermore there are likely to be numerous bugs, shortcomings and parts currently unimplemented to contend with. There is also a distinct lack of documentation and examples at the moment.


<h2>Availability</h2>

<p>If you remain undaunted, you can <a href="download/">download</a> prototype versions available under a MIT/BSD-style licence. Please send all comments to <a href="mailto:ltratt@convergepl.org">Laurence Tratt</a>.
