<h2>What is Converge?</h2>

Converge is a dynamic object orientated programming language with compile-time meta-programming facilities - put more simply, Converge has macocs. Converge's compile-time meta-programming facility can be used to arbitrarily extend Converge's syntax. Converge was designed and is implemented by <a href="mailto:ltratt@convergepl.org">Laurence Tratt</a>.
